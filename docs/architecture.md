# Architecture

The HTTP API, administration portal and active MCP v2 facade share one
application context, one Roon client and the same persisted services. The
composition root constructs those dependencies once and passes typed context
objects to each delivery layer.

Static portal assets live in `portal/` and are copied into the Docker image.
The main API listens on `3000`; the portal listens on `3001`. Both servers run
inside the same Node.js process so they observe the same Roon subscription,
playlists and database without registering a second extension.

## Dependency Direction

```text
process startup
  -> application composition
    -> Roon adapters, database and application services
      -> HTTP API, portal and MCP v2 delivery layers
```

Delivery layers may orchestrate application services but do not construct a
second copy of them. Widely imported media, playlist and MCP classes remain
stable facades while pure contracts and policies move into focused modules.

## Current Runtime Flow

1. `src/index.ts` loads configuration and asks `createApplication` to compose
   the logger, database, Roon adapters and application services.
2. If `ENABLE_AUTH=true`, `API_TOKEN` is required before startup continues.
3. The shared Roon client starts discovery and subscriptions.
4. Express starts the HTTP API on `PORT`; the portal is mounted separately on
   its configured port using the same `ApplicationContext`.
5. Public health, privacy and OAuth discovery routes remain outside Bearer
   authentication. Protected routes use the existing token/OAuth policy.
6. API and portal routes call the shared services for state, media, queues,
   playlists, configuration and administration.
7. `src/bridge-v2/mcp/index.ts` launches the same MCP v2 server used by the HTTP
   transport when `pnpm run mcp` is invoked.
8. `POST /mcp` and `GET /mcp` expose the 36 canonical intents and six focused
   widget entry points over Streamable HTTP.
9. Typed media search creates short-lived references and re-resolves selected
   media in a fresh Roon Browse session before acting.
10. On SIGTERM or SIGINT, both HTTP listeners stop accepting work before Roon
    discovery, scheduled checks, logs and SQLite are closed in order.

## Persistence

`src/db/database.ts` is the single source of truth for the SQLite model and its
ordered migration IDs. Every migration runs transactionally and is recorded in
`schema_migrations`, so an existing database is upgraded once without deleting
playlists or settings. The model includes application settings, cores, cached
zones, playlists and tracks, history, preferences and search data. RoonIA
persists Roon authorization state in
`data/roonstate.json`, SQLite application state in `data/roonia.sqlite`, and
private OAuth clients/codes/tokens in `data/oauth-store.json`.

On first launch with an empty SQLite store, legacy playlists from
`data/virtual-playlists.json` are imported automatically. Playlist rows created
before the current identity model are enriched on service start without
changing their stable IDs or reusing stale Roon Browse references.

Runtime port, update-channel and public bridge/portal URL overrides live in
`data/runtime-config.json`. Update requests and staged results use
`data/update-request.json` and `data/update-status.json` as a narrow handoff
between the app container and the LXC systemd watcher.

## Build And Installation Flow

Pushes and pull requests are validated by GitHub Actions. Successful pushes to
`main` and `beta` publish multi-architecture images to GHCR with `stable` and
`beta` tags. The portal only offers a commit after its image workflow succeeded.

The LXC keeps a sparse Git checkout containing Compose and host scripts, not a
Node.js build environment. During an update, it pulls the selected image, makes
a pre-update data backup, stops the current container gracefully and verifies
the replacement health. A failed replacement restores the previous image,
environment and data.
